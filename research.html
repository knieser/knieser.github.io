					<p> Health care quality can vary considerably across providers and health systems. Differences in quality measures between providers might be due to an artifact of chance as opposed to true differences in 
						quality of care. Reliability quantifies the stability of a measurement if we could somehow repeat the measurement again in another sample
						from the sample population of patients and providers in the same time period. Reliability is one scientific criterion by which prospective
						CMS measures are evaluated.</p>

					<p><u>Summary:</u></p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>We conducted simulation studies of the split-sample method for estimating reliability
								and found that estimates can be very sensitive to the random split of the data in low sample size and low performance variability settings.
								We show that averaging many split-sample estimates can reduce the variability of the split-sample estimate of reliability.

							We reviewed various methods for estimating reliability of health care quality measures and compared estimates in the case of two mental health quality measure sets. 
							We found that estimates can differ substantially, especially when sample sizes are small. More work is needed to understand which methods should be preferred in which situations.

						<p><u>Summary:</u></p>
						<ul> 
							<li> <p>In many health studies, select population subgroups&mdash;such as racial and ethnic minorities, older adults, 
								and adults with less than a high school education&mdash;consistently make up a smaller proportion of the data sample compared to others. 
								This has led to study findings (and consequently medical decisions) that generalize well for some sociodemographic subgroups and poorly 
								for others. </p>
								<p>
									<img width="500" src="sampling_diagram.png" alt="Diagram of two ways of generalizing: out-of-sample and within-sample" class="center"/>
								</p>
								<p>We showed under some assumptions that the difference in mean-squared error of 
								sample average treatment effect estimates for two subgroups is equal to the product of (1) the difference in subgroup sample proportions and (2)
								the average squared difference between subgroup treatment effects. The formula derived in our paper could be used to
								inform design, analysis, and interpretation of studies in heterogeneous populations.</p>
								<p>We developed a reweighting approach for adjusting sample representation in a way that
								lowers mean-squared error of subgroup-specific effect estimation on average, which we call 
								representation-adjusted average treatment effect (RATE) estimation. This approach enables each subgroup to leverage information from the full sample rather than 
								the subgroup's own data only. This reduces statistical noise at the expense of some bias.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>In psychiatry and clinical psychology, models are used to make sense of psychological symptom patterns to inform diagnostic categories and the development of 
								screening and measurement instruments. However, these models might not describe all individuals equally well.</p>
								<p>We proposed a robust estimation alternative to the EM algorithm (commonly used in latent variable model estimation), 
								which we call REM (robust expectation-maximization algorithm), 
								to detect subsets in a data sample that are poorly described by a fitted model. This can help researchers understand and 
								work towards improving the generalizability of their models.</p>

								<p>This approach is built on replacing the likelihood function with a mixture between the likelihood function and an unknown process, represented by \(\epsilon\), which we treat as a hyperparameter:</p>
								\[ f_{X|\theta}(x) \rightarrow \gamma f_{X|\theta}(x) + (1-\gamma)\epsilon \] </p>
								<p>In the simple 2D example below, the dark blue dots in the REM plot on the right denote individuals with reported symptom patterns that do not
									neatly fit into either of the two major subgroups, shown by the ellipses.

							</li>
							<li>				
								<p> We applied the REM method described above to postpartum depressive symptom data to detect and 
								describe differential depressive symptom patterns and examine associations with demographics and psychiatric histories. </p>
								<p> About 10% of our sample did not fit the exploratory factor analysis model well. This subset was more likely to have severe depressive symptoms, particularly regarding negative self-judgement and thoughts of self-harm.
								This subset was also more likely to have a history of childhood trauma and/or a history of social anxiety disorder. </p>
								<p>	I built an R Shiny app to demonstrate how information from the REM fit could be used to predict which individuals are likely to be in this subset based on self-reported depressive symptoms.
								This information could inform the tailoring of screening and treatment stratgies for postpartum depression.
