					<h2>Statistical reliability of health care quality measures</h2>
					<p>To provide useful information to patients, clinicians, and policy-makers, quantitative measures of health care quality 
						need to be statistically reliable&mdash;that is, quality measures ideally should reflect true
						differences in quality of care and not statistical noise. Statistical reliability is defined as the fraction of total variance in outcomes \(\sigma_Y^2\)
						that is due to the between-provider variance \(\sigma_b^2\) as follows: </p>					
						\[ \rho := \frac{\sigma_b^2}{\sigma_Y^2} .\]
					<p> We are currently working on evaluating and comparing various methods for calculating reliability in the context of health care quality measures.</p>

					<h2>Quantifying and reducing inequity in average treatment effect estimation</h2>
					<p>In many health studies, some population subgroups&mdash;such as racial and ethnic minorities, older adults, 
					and adults with less than a high school education&mdash;consistently make up a smaller proportion of the data sample compared to others. 
					We quantified the impact this disparity has on the generalizailiby of average treatment effects. 
					We developed a reweighting approach for adjusting sample representation in a way that
					lowers mean-squared error of subgroup-specific effect estimation on average, which we call 
					representation-adjusted average treatment effect (RATE) estimation. This approach is similar
					to a Bayesian shrinkage estimator which enables subgroups to borrow information from other subgroups, which reduces statistical noise at the expense
					of some bias.</p>

					<p>This manuscript is currently under review. Code for the simulations and the RATE estimator are available here: [<a style="font-family:Calibri" href="https://github.com/knieser/RATE" target="_blank">code</a>]

					<h2> Detecting disparities in model fit with the REM algorithm </h2>
					<p>Models do not necessarily describe all individuals equally well. 
					To detect subsets in a data sample that are poorly described by a fitted model, 
					we proposed a robust estimation alternative to the EM algorithm (commonly used in latent variable model estimation), 
					which we call REM (robust expectation-maximization algorithm) [<a style="font-family:Calibri" href="https://doi.org/10.1037/met0000413" target="_blank">paper</a>]
					[<a style="font-family:Calibri" href="https://github.com/knieser/REM" target="_blank">code</a>].</p>
					<p>This approach is built on replacing the likelihood function with a mixture between the likelihood function and an unknown process, represented by \(\epsilon\), which we treat as a hyperparameter:</p>
					\[ f_{X|\theta}(x) \rightarrow \gamma f_{X|\theta}(x) + (1-\gamma)\epsilon \]

					<h4>Application: Postpartum depressive symptoms</h4>
					<p> We applied this method to postpartum depressive symptom data to detect and 
						describe differential depressive symptom patterns and examine associations with demographics and psychiatric histories [<a style="font-family:Calibri" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eclinm.2023.101830" target="_blank">paper</a>]. 
					</p>
					<p>	In our sample, we fit an exploratory factor analysis model and found that about 10% of our sample did not fit the model well.
						This subset was more likely to have severe depressive symptoms, particularly regarding negative self-judgement and thoughts of self-harm.
						This subset was also more likely to have a history of childhood trauma and/or a history of social anxiety disorder.
						I built an <a style="font-family:Calibri" href="http://knieser.shinyapps.io/app_subgrouppredict" target="_blank">R Shiny app</a>
						to demonstrate how information from the REM fit could be used to predict which individuals are likely to be in this subset based on self-reported depressive symptoms.
						This information could inform the tailoring of screening and treatment stratgies for postpartum depression.
