					<h3> Social Epidemiology </h3>
					<h4> On independent effects </h4>
					<blockquote cite = "https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a009969"><em>It is now common practice in social epidemiology to adjust for multiple social factors when attempting to isolate the 'independent' effect of some single measure []. Examinations of income effects are routinely adjusted for education and other factors, for example, and failure to do so has been met in our experience with reviewer complaints that 'important sources of confounding were not controlled.' But given the existence of a <u>social structure</u> that conditions the relations between variables (i.e., an economic system that reproduces labor, a racial caste system that reproduces inequality, etc.), what is the possible meaning of an 'independent' effect of income? In the experimental and counterfactual models, it is the causal effect associated with a change in that exposure while all other conditions are held constant. However, in <u>this</u> world, where real people live, those other factors are <u>not</u> held constant---they vary and interact in particular, structured ways that reflect the organization of society. People with a given income value did not arrive at that value through a randomization process or anything remotely close to it; rather, they arrived at the observed value through a dynamic life trajectory that was shaped by an organized context of institutions and social relations. There can be no meaningful interpretation of an 'independent' effect in this setting, since it does not correspond to any consequence of exposure that can isolated from the mechanism of treatment assignment.</em></blockquote>
