					<h3> Connections between physics and epidemiology </h3>
					(December 2020)
					<p>My undergraduate training was in physics and so I can't help but apply what I learned then to what I am working on today. I think there are similarities between the two but also important differences. Both physics and epidemiology seek to understand dynamic processes. Generally speaking, in physics, we want to understand how objects (insert almost anything you can think of) move, change, and interact over time. In epidemiology, we first want to understand the lay-of-the-land, how health and disease are distributed throughout a population, and then start to parse out the processes that generated these distributions. Understanding health disparities is at the core of epidemiology in my mind.</p>
					
					<p> Another key difference with epidemiology is the intention to produce change. Physics alone is purely about understanding the world. Epidemiology aims to understand the world so that we can change it. For this reason, epidemiologists study the effects of interventions and treatments on populations.</p>
					
					<p>In tackling a physics problem, the usual approach is to first, write down what we know (data) and write down what we would like to know (estimand). Then, use existing theory to write down how these quantities of interest relate to one another (DAG). Lastly, use mathematics to turn the crank and obtain the quantity (estimate) that we are interested in. </p>
					
					<p>To me, one of the biggest differences with epidemiology is the part where we apply existing theory. The equivalent of Maxwell's equations which govern classical electrodynamics does not exist for the processes that lead to the onset of hypertension, for example. It seems there are (at least) two reasons for this. One, the processes that lead to onset of hypertension are vastly more complex. Theoretically it contains all of electrodynamics plus the forces of history, social dynamics, life course, behavior, genetics, environment, etc. Two, whereas electrodynamics is (in a classical, non-quantum sense) deterministic, the onset of hypertension is stochastic (or at least appears to be). There is some amount of chance that is inescapable. This is not to say that the onset of hypertension is completely random. There are systems that induce and constrain these probabilities. Nancy Krieger refers to this as <q>structured chance (1) .</q> With this in mind, I would say there are two fronts in epidemiology: understanding the structures that connect variables of interest and analyzing the variability in those structures.</p>

					<h3> On independent effects </h3>
					<blockquote cite = "https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a009969"><em>It is now common practice in social epidemiology to adjust for multiple social factors when attempting to isolate the 'independent' effect of some single measure []. Examinations of income effects are routinely adjusted for education and other factors, for example, and failure to do so has been met in our experience with reviewer complaints that 'important sources of confounding were not controlled.' But given the existence of a <u>social structure</u> that conditions the relations between variables (i.e., an economic system that reproduces labor, a racial caste system that reproduces inequality, etc.), what is the possible meaning of an 'independent' effect of income? In the experimental and counterfactual models, it is the causal effect associated with a change in that exposure while all other conditions are held constant. However, in <u>this</u> world, where real people live, those other factors are <u>not</u> held constant---they vary and interact in particular, structured ways that reflect the organization of society. People with a given income value did not arrive at that value through a randomization process or anything remotely close to it; rather, they arrived at the observed value through a dynamic life trajectory that was shaped by an organized context of institutions and social relations. There can be no meaningful interpretation of an 'independent' effect in this setting, since it does not correspond to any consequence of exposure that can isolated from the mechanism of treatment assignment.</em></blockquote>
